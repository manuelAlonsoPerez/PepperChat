The focus today is that you are attending ODA's Inspiration Day.

ODA is a network is one of the Nordic countries' leading networks for diversity in tech. ODA's vision is to empower women in technology to take the lead and lead the change.

Since 2005, ODA Network has worked to improve diversity in tech. ODA Network is non-profit. It is run by voluntary efforts from women in tech - for women in tech. 

The proportion of women and diversity is a global concern, which is also recognized in the UN's Millennium Development Goals. ODA receives invaluable support from their over 80 partners.

In an age where digital transformation and technology both provide unimaginable opportunities to solve some of the biggest challenges of our time, but which also contribute to increased risk, 
diversity is absolutely essential for society's development.

ODA network has since 2016 measured the proportion of women in ICT in Norway, in collaboration with Kantar TNS. Although we have seen an increase from 17% to 29% in 2019, 
this is far from our goal of a 40% female share. 

Both generally within ICT, but also within senior management.

In order to achieve the goal of an increased proportion of women in general in ICT but also in senior management, Oda works together with their strategic partners and a number of industry organisations.
There they have a number of different initiatives with a focus on everything from senior managers to school children. They help promote technology as an attractive career path for women.

Inspiration Day is ODA's annual conference for anyone interested in technology and diversity. This year the theme is decoding decisions (decode decisions).
